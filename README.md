# Designing a Product

This will be the app you will be building throughout your weeks of learning Rails by adding different components to it. The theme of the app is...

**The Sharing Economy**

Think of sites like [Airbnb](http://www.airbnb.com) or [GetAround](https://www.getaround.com/) or even broad rental marketplaces to rent gadgets or cameras. Choose a vertical that you are interested in, and think about the product design based on it. The product being shared has to be physical in nature.

You will take today to design and plan the app that you would want to build. Brainstorm and come out with ideas and decide on a vertical that you want to build your sharing site upon.

### Setup
Before you start:

- Sign up to [Whimsical](https://whimsical.co)
- Sign up to [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and install the desktop app from [this page](https://www.figma.com/downloads/) for Windows and Mac or by using this terminal command for Ubuntu: ```sudo snap install figma-linux```


### Time Guidelines

- **9:15am to 10:15am** (60 min) ðŸ‘‰ Define your product pitch, primary persona and write down your core user journey. Make a copy of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OGCJLizpcROt0WwbGV_bCOxBktHO9XPdNHkXcZIyX1o/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">UX Research spreadsheet</a> and complete the different templates.
- **10:15am - 11:30am** (75 min) ðŸ‘‰  Translate the core user journey into a user flow with [Whimsical](https://whimsical.co)
- **11:30am - 1pm** (90 min) ðŸ‘‰ Build your UI kit and start working on your wireframe with Figma.

### After Lunch:

- **2pm to 3:30pm**: Come up with the creative side of your application - is it themed? What vibe is it supposed to give out? What kind of visual identity will you have? After finishing your prototype, integrate that to your wireframe . It's more strategic to have a kickass prototype in black and white rather than a poor mockup with lots of pictures and colors but that no one understands ðŸ˜¬.
- **3:30pm to 5pm** Presentation

### Resources for visual identity

#### Design resources

- **Fonts**: download and install `.ttf` fonts from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) or [getthefont](https://www.getthefont.com/)
- **Colors**: find them on [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/) or use a color picker like [Colorzilla](http://www.colorzilla.com/)
- **Pictures**: you can use [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
- **Icons**: download and use [Nucleo app](https://nucleoapp.com/) for utility icons

### Pitch
When you are done, copy / paste your prototype URL on Slack. To get the prototype URL, first play your prototype and then click on the `Share  Prototype` button like below:

At 3:30pm, you will pitch your product by showcasing your prototype.
